# IBM-DATA-ANALYST-CERTIFICATION

A group of courses starting from data scraping till visulaization are part of this Certification.
Every module has good Theoritical explanations and Practical exercises to work with followed by Experst Opinion of what is the role played by this Module.
Every Course has a Project at the end , which helps to pracice as well as analyse our skills learned in the Course.
Final Capstone Project will cover all those skills learnt through the Courses.

PROCESS:

Data Extraction :           From API using Requests
                            From WEB using BeautifulSoup

Data Wrangling  :
                            Finding & Removing Duplicates
                            Normalizing or scaling data 
                            Data binning 
                            Normalizing (turning categorical into numerical variables and also making them apt for others variables)
              
EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS : 
                            Descriptive statistics for summary 
                            Grouby (grouping the data to know better info ) 
                            Correlation b/w data & advanced correlation stats methods
                            Conclusion to consider most Correlated Variables from Data

METHOD DEVELOPMENT : 
                            Linear regression, with single or multiple variables calculation wrt to target (any variable which we are instrested), 
                            Polynomial regression (if linear doesnâ€™t seem good) , 
                            Evaluation also performed using visual (residual and distributed plots )
                            In-sample numerical  (r2 and mean square error)
                            
DATA VISUALIZATION :        
                            Matplotlib ( Using calculated results from Python Numpy & Pandas)
                            IBM COGNOS for DASHBOARD
